* `HEAD` - special pointer tracking the current commit/branch
* `master` - branch - pointing to commit `f30ab`
* `testing` - branch - pointing to commit `f30ab`

```bash

$> git log --oneline
   f30ab ...
   34ac2 ...
   98ca9 ...
```

# HEAD is now pointing to testing branch
```

```bash
$> touch newfile.txt
$> git commit -a -m "new commit on testing branch"

# New commit, testing branch has moved "forwards"
# HEAD is now pointing to testing branch

# testing branch remains pointing to 87ab2 
# HEAD is now pointing to master branch
```

```bash
$> touch newfile2.txt
$> git commit -a -m "new commit on master branch"

# testing branch remains pointing to 87ab2
# master branch now points to c2b9e
# HEAD is pointing to master branch
# Branches have diverged
```

```bash
$> git merge testing

# testing branch remains pointing to 87ab2
# master branch now points to v1ab5
# HEAD is pointing to master branch
# Merge commit v1ab5 created
```

* Commit `v1ab5` could include conflict resolution
* Commit `v1ab5` has two parent commits
* No commits are amended - commit history preserved
