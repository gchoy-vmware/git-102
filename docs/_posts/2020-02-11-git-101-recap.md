## Recording changes

Git does the bookkeeping of your changes in the repository - also known as the Git Index.

### Commit a file

```bash
$> ls file.txt                      # Modified
$> git add file.txt                 # Staged
$> git commit -m "commit file.txt"  # Unmodified
$> git status
     On branch master
     Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
     nothing to commit, working directory clean
```
