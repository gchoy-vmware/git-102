## Rebasing

### Relevant documentation

* [Git Rebasing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing)

### Overview

* Rebasing can be reworded to: "replay my changes on-top of commit.."
  * Find your own "explanation"
* Side effects: you will be amending your commits!
  * "Do not amend commits you've pushed or not the author of!"
* Linear history

```bash
$> git rebase testing

# testing branch remains pointing to 87ab2
# master branch now points to zxy12
# HEAD is pointing to master branch
```

* Commit `zxy12` could include conflict resolution
* Commit `zxy12` has one parent commit
* Commit `zxy12` is the amended commit of `c2b9e`
* What if I had pushed commit `c2b9e` prior to the rebase?
* What if I want to amend my commit(s) during a rebase?
  * A: `git rebase -i`
